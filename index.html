<br>Created as a way to share a sample of this interactive and manipulative photobook, a tool for critical reflection and discussion with co-educators, children, and families in early learning programs. I made this resource as a part of my Masters of Education (Early Childhood Education) capstone project. <br> <br>

<b>About this book</b> <br>
<br>This book was born as a way to experiment and think with the questions such as what does it mean to care here, in and with this place? What might a pedagogy of care with the forest look like in my practice as a Forest School Practitioner? How might a pedagogy of care with the forest, with the children in the program where I work disrupt how we think about and with nature, and the more-than-human?<br> 

<br><br><b>Acknowledgments</b><br> 
<br>I am forever grateful to the land and its gifts that sustain and inspire me in my daily life and work as an early childhood educator. I am also grateful to all those who have been thinking with these questions long before me. Your experiments, thoughts, questions, creative expressions, and radical ideas have provoked me to slow down, think otherwise and listen deeply. To “stay with the trouble (Haraway 2016).” <br>

I am also grateful to the important people in my life - my family (including my pets Dakota and Pablo), friends, co-workers, children, families, and community of early childhood 
educators who have nourished my joy and curiosities throughout the process of completing my masters and this resource.<br>
